Steps to compile and run
To install all dependencies, compile and run tests:
$ bin/setup
To run the code so it accepts input from a file:
$ bin/parking_lot file_inputs.txt

Some Design Considerations :
--------------------------
1. The parking lot is generic enough to accept Vehicle of any type. The design is open for extension.
2. Since, level is not defined in the problem /input , default level 1 is being passed. The design ofcourse supports multilevel parking, where each parking level has its own parking spots and capacity.
3. The design supports parking spot of various kinds, which is open for extension.
4. Since, the size or performance of parking lot has not been clearly defined in the problem, I have provided DataScale Strategies. Based on the desired space and time complexities appropriate choice can be made.
5. Parking strategy has been selected as NearestSlotFirst , i.e. the closest slot from the entry will be allocated . This again , can be extended further, based on requirements, without making any change in the exisiting design.
6. Code coverage report can be checked here - parking_lot/build/reports/tests/test/packages/parkinglot.html
7. Gradle has been used for project dependencies.
8. Gradle version-4 and above has been considered for this project.
